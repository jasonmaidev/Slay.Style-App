### Getting Started

Once you've logged in, simply head over to `Wardrobe` page and then select `Reset Wardrobe`` if you are on desktop or click the button on the homepage if you are on a smartphone, to replenish the current wardrobe with a preset of selected apparels to try out some of the app's styling features.

You have 2 instances of `Reset Wardrobe`s per day in case you accidentally delete certain apparels from your guest account.
