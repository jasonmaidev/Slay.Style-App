### Closed Beta MVP Access

User registration is currently unavailable to the public but the web-app is fully functional and live, accessible via email invite.

If you've found this repository, it is more than likely that you've also received an email invitation with your unique guest user credentials. Please go ahead and login to the application with the provided guest account username + password and try out some awesome features `Slay.Style` has to offer!

### Getting Started

Once you've logged in, simply head over to `Wardrobe` page and then select `Reset Wardrobe` if you are on desktop or click the button on the homepage if you are on a smartphone, to replenish the current wardrobe with a preset of selected apparels to try out some of the app's styling features.

You have 2 instances of `Reset Wardrobe`s per day in case you accidentally delete certain apparels from your guest account.
Apparel `uploads` are currently disabled for guest users but will be available again once data sanitization is fully implemented.

*Please note that the default app content limitations for guest users may be subject to change with or without notice as there may be ongoing updates behind the scenes regarding the app's deployment infrastructures.
